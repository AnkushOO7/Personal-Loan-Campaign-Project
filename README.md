## 📌 Project Title: **Personal Loan Prediction for AllLife Bank**

### 🏦 Project Overview

AllLife Bank, a growing financial institution in the US, is experiencing a steady increase in its liability customer base (i.e., depositors). However, the number of customers who also hold personal loans (asset customers) remains relatively small. In a bid to enhance profitability and balance their asset-liability portfolio, the bank is keen on converting a portion of its existing depositors into personal loan customers.

Last year, a marketing campaign targeting liability customers achieved a promising conversion rate of over **9%**, encouraging the marketing team to explore more targeted, data-driven strategies to improve this success rate. This project aims to support this initiative by leveraging machine learning models to identify potential customers with a **high probability of purchasing personal loans**, while ensuring they are retained as depositors.

### 🎯 Objectives

* **Predict** whether a liability customer is likely to purchase a personal loan.
* **Identify** the most significant customer attributes influencing the decision to buy a personal loan.
* **Segment** customers based on predicted likelihood to help marketing teams target high-probability customers more efficiently.

### 📊 Data Description

The dataset includes demographic and behavioral information about existing customers of AllLife Bank. Key features typically include:

* Customer demographics (e.g., age, income, family size, education level)
* Account and transactional data (e.g., account balance, credit card usage)
* Past marketing interaction results (e.g., response to previous campaigns)
* Product holdings (e.g., securities account, online banking, CD account)

### 🛠️ Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand the data distribution, missing values, and feature relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle encoding, scaling, missing value imputation, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Building** – Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict personal loan purchase.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. **Insights & Interpretation** – Analyze feature importance and derive actionable insights for customer targeting.

### ✅ Key Outcomes

* A predictive model capable of classifying liability customers by their likelihood of opting for a personal loan.
* A ranked list of influential features that drive personal loan purchase decisions.
* A customer segmentation framework to support personalized marketing campaigns and improve conversion rates.

### 📌 Conclusion

By deploying this predictive model, AllLife Bank’s marketing department can adopt a smarter, more focused approach to campaign planning. The model enables the bank to identify customers who are more inclined to take a personal loan, thereby improving campaign efficiency, optimizing marketing costs, and ultimately increasing revenue through higher loan conversions.
